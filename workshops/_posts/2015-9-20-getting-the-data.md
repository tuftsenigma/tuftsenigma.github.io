Ever wanted to collect statistics or answer some big questions about a large amount of data? Interested in running statistical analyses on data related to an issue you're passionate about?

This is a workshop open to the general Tufts community about using Python to scrape public data for the purposes of analysis / data mining. Individuals of all programming experience are welcome as this will be in the context of 'data journalism', not computer science.
