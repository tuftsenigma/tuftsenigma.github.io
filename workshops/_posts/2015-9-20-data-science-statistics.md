This is our second workshop this year. We will be focusing on how to acquire data from the Internet using sources rather than data scraping or other programming-intensive methods. We will also be teaching you how to use Orange (http://orange.biolab.si/), a user friendly data science suite in Python (don't worry, this time we don't expect you to have any background in Python whatsoever!). The purpose of this workshop is to focus on the journalism rather than coding. And afterwards, you will meet and get to know your project groups for this semester!

If you are interested in working on a piece for the Tufts Independent Data Journal and you'd like to learn some awesome (not to mention employable) data-centric skills along the way, come join us Wednesday night at Halligan 102!
