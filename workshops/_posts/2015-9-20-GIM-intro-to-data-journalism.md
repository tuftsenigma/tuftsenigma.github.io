In today's technological climate, big data has transformed the way we make decisions, buy things, meet people, conduct business, understand behavior... and most importantly, how we can analyze important social, political, and economic issues.

Tufts Enigma, the University's first and premier independent data journalism group, is situated right at the crossroads of 'data science' and relevant real world issues. In the past, our issues have covered such as LGBTQ in tech, STEM education, and mental health trends in student confessions. 

This year, we are doing something special by putting together a workshop series - so that you too can use data journalism on a project you're passionate about! 

If you are interested in working on a piece for the Tufts Independent Data Journal and you'd like to learn some awesome (not to mention employable) data-centric + machine learning skills along the way, come join us Tuesday night at Eaton 202!
