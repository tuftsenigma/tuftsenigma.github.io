Come to this exciting (first ever!) joint workshop by Tufts Enigma and Tufts Observer on infographics + design in the journalism process! Featuring Chelsea Newman from the Observer and Angie Sijun Lou and Soubhik Barari from Enigma.

We will discuss design + visual / data journalism in a hands-on, 'show-not-tell' way, and give you a glimpse at how we create our visuals, in addition talk about / recommend some of the easy-to-use tools that you can pick up for your own projects.
