One of the most beautiful and terrifying things is a blank page. There's so much potential it's easy to believe that what you fill it with won't live up to your expectations. So how do you ever start?

Well I could joke and say that the key is low expectations, but I don't really believe that you should even have expectations when it comes to creativity. Your only expectation should be that you are actually going to make something, and it's something that inspires you.

### My Story

I have always considered myself a creator. From painting to filmmaking to songwriting to programming, I’ve always been a fan of expressing myself through building something bigger than myself. However this also led to me being a generalist: knowing how to do a lot, but never getting too good at any one skill.

My story really starts when I figured out that my desire to create translated into entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs are encouraged to be generalists, **modern renaissance men**.

But notice how I say men. Don’t mean to get to bring up gender issues here, but a lot of the obstacles that I have encountered along my entrepreneurial journey trace back to being a woman. For example, in the first three minutes of a pitch to investors, they decide whether or not you are someone they want to have a beer with, and men are usually more likely to pass that test. Whether you can identify with me or not, we’ll all have hurdles along the way to creating. The key is to not let them get you down but instead persevere.

I’m currently working on a startup called Navi that I have been hoping to create since my sophomore year and finally have the tools to do so. My cofounder, Marcy Regalado, and I were finalists in the Tufts 100k and although we didn’t win, we plan to persevere and build what we envision.

### Your Story

So now that you know all about me, it’s your chance to get out there and fill your page with something that makes you happy, whether this is entrepreneurship or choreographing or writing. The key is to just get started.

So how do you get started?
Some things I like to do to find inspiration include:

* Playing the guitar
* Drawing
* Writing a journal entry
* Taking a bike ride
* Blogging
* Listening to music

But the below infographic has a bunch more suggestions for how to stay creative (and I’m sure Google has a bunch more suggestions to get you inspired.) Just remember to let go of all expectations and put your mark on that blank page.
